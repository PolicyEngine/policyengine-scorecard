# Replaying the event corpus on every certified release

Status: design contract for workstream W6 of the Autumn Budget 2026 CI plan,
11 October 2026. It extends the track 1 replay ([RECIPE.md](RECIPE.md),
[YEARS.md](YEARS.md)) from one hard-pinned world to any number of
**certified replay variants**, and turns each variant's run into a receipt
that release qualification (W4, policyengine.py) can consume before a
model/data pair is promoted.

Nothing here changes a registered construction. A variant reruns the same
frozen registries; where a construction's premise no longer holds on a
variant, that is reported as a construction revision for review, never
silently repaired. Methodology changes (counterfactual intent, annualisation
semantics, acceptance policy) wait on cos d1344.

## Why the existing runner cannot rerun

Read in code at `61c13e38`:

* `pipeline/uk_engine_registry.py` refuses any engine except `2.89.2`.
* `compute_uk_ab2025.preflight()` and `compute_uk_obr_costings.assert_engine_matches_bundle()`
  read `data/uk/certified_bundle.json`, whose only compatible model is
  `policyengine-uk ==2.89.2`, and require the installed engine to equal it.
* `modal_uk_event.py` hardcodes `ENGINE_PINS` (`policyengine 5.0.2`,
  core `3.27.1`, UK `2.89.2`), the populace Hugging Face cache layout and
  the audited HF commit.
* `compute_uk_event.validate_years` allows CY2023–2030 for every run.
* `compare_uk_event.review_diagnosis` attaches ten 2.89.2 findings to every
  row with `"engine_version": "2.89.2"` whatever engine produced the row;
  `construction_note` states 2.89.2 facts (the £3.15 Class 2 rate, "the pin
  still has the 3% surcharge scale") unconditionally.
* `diagnose_uk_event_models.investigate` refuses any engine but 2.89.2.

The newest certified pair is policyengine.py **6.2.6** (PR #555 and its
version bump `481940ec`): `policyengine-uk 2.125.1`, `policyengine-core
3.33.0`, data `policyengine-uk-data-1.58.0`, default dataset
`enhanced_frs_2024_25` (SHA-256 `5ba399ea…60b6`, 128,369,110 bytes,
`hf://policyengine/policyengine-uk-data-private/enhanced_frs_2024_25.h5@1.58.0`).

Measured on that pair on 11 October with the installed wheels (one managed
simulation, offline, no token):

* The HDF5's `time_period` table holds `["2024"]`; the managed simulation's
  `dataset.years` is `[2024, …, 2030]` (`extend_single_year_dataset`,
  `end_year=2030`, in `policyengine_uk/data/economic_assumptions.py`).
* **Calculating 2023 does not raise.** `income_tax` for 2023 sums to £0.0bn,
  against £275.5bn in 2024: the simulation has no 2023 inputs and returns
  defaults. Year support therefore has to be enforced from the data; a
  successful calculation proves nothing.
* `pe.uk.managed_microsimulation()` materialises the default dataset at
  `./data/<file>` relative to the working directory (policyengine.py
  `provenance/dataset_materialization.py`, `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR = Path("./data")`),
  reusing a file whose SHA-256 matches and otherwise downloading over HTTPS.
  The 5.0.2 HF-cache mirror path does not apply.
* With no Hugging Face token the release-manifest fetch fails and the
  wrapper uses its packaged certification (`compatibility_basis
  "legacy_compatible_model_package"`, `certified_for_model_version
  "2.125.1"`). With a token, `certify_data_release_compatibility` derives a
  certification from the remote release manifest instead, which changes
  `release_bundle` fields. The 5.0.2 audit recorded the same split
  (`OFFLINE_BUNDLE_AUDIT.json`, `release_bundle_field_changes_if_remote_manifest_is_available`).
* Peak resident memory for the baseline load plus five annual aggregates was
  2.3GB; the whole probe took 10.6s.

## Certified replay variants

`data/uk/replay_variants.json` lists every variant the corpus may run on.
`data/uk/certified_bundle.json` is unchanged and remains the legacy
variant's identity: AB2025, the OBR-costing runner and every existing
receipt keep reading it byte-for-byte.

```json
{
 "schema_version": 1,
 "default_variant": "<legacy variant_id>",
 "variants": [ <variant record>, ... ]
}
```

A variant record:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `variant_id` | `pe<wrapper>_uk<model>_<certified_data_build_id>`; must equal the slug recomputed from `identity`. |
| `identity` | Everything that determines execution. Its canonical-JSON SHA-256 is `identity_sha256`. |
| `identity.packages` | For `policyengine`, `policyengine-uk`, `policyengine-core`: exact `version`, and `record_sha256`, the SHA-256 of the installed distribution's `RECORD` file (it lists every installed file with its hash, so it binds the wheel contents). Optional `wheel_sha256` when the wheel itself was hashed. |
| `identity.packaged_bundle_manifest_sha256` | SHA-256 of `policyengine/data/bundle/manifest.json` as installed. |
| `identity.release_bundle` | The exact `pe.uk.uk_latest.release_bundle` dict expected at runtime under **packaged (offline) certification**. |
| `identity.dataset` | `repo_id`, `repo_type`, `revision`, `path`, `sha256`, `size_bytes`, `uri`. |
| `identity.materialization` | `hf_cache_mirror` (policyengine 5.x: the existing HF-cache plus `data/uk/policyengine-local` mirror) or `policyengine_data_dir` (6.x: a verified copy at `<runtime dir>/data/<path>`). |
| `identity.python` | Interpreter minor version, e.g. `3.12`. |
| `requirements` | `{path, sha256}`: the exact freeze installed for this variant. Legacy: `docs/uk_replay/requirements.txt`. Others: `docs/uk_replay/requirements/<variant_id>.txt`. |
| `data_years` | Calendar years the population supports: from the dataset's first `time_period` through the engine's extension end, as observed in `simulation.dataset.years`. |
| `data_years_evidence` | The observed `time_period`, `dataset.years` and the engine file/line that sets the extension end. |
| `certification` | Where the pairing is certified: `source` (e.g. `policyengine.py 6.2.6 packaged manifest`), `compatibility_basis`, `certified_for_model_version`, `data_build_id`. |
| `status` | `certified` (a released policyengine.py bundle), `candidate` (a W4 qualification request; never a default), or `retired`. |
| `qualification_request_sha256` | For candidates, the request the variant was built from. |
| `executor` | `local` (GitHub runner or workstation) and/or `modal`. The populace 1.3GB dataset needs Modal's 32GiB; the 128MB enhanced FRS runs on a 16GB runner. |

### What "validated exactly" means

Before any simulation the runner checks, in order, and refuses on the first
failure:

1. **Record consistency (engine-free).** `variant_id` and `identity_sha256`
   recompute; `release_bundle.model_version == packages["policyengine-uk"].version`;
   `release_bundle.policyengine_version == packages["policyengine"].version`;
   `certification.certified_for_model_version == packages["policyengine-uk"].version`;
   `release_bundle.certified_data_artifact_sha256 == dataset.sha256`;
   `release_bundle.certified_data_build_id == certification.data_build_id`;
   `release_bundle.default_dataset_uri` names `dataset.repo_id`, `path` and
   `revision`; the requirements file hashes to `requirements.sha256` and pins
   exactly the three package versions. For the legacy variant, additionally
   `certified_bundle.json`'s `revision`, `sha256`, `size_bytes`, `repo_id`
   and `compatible_model_packages` agree with the record.
2. **Installed environment.** Installed versions of the three packages equal
   the record; each installed `RECORD` hashes to `record_sha256`; the
   installed packaged manifest hashes to `packaged_bundle_manifest_sha256`;
   the interpreter minor version matches.
3. **Certification path.** Before importing the engine the runner removes
   `HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN`, `HF_TOKEN` and `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_TOKEN` from the
   environment and forces Hugging Face offline mode, so the wrapper uses its
   packaged certification on every host. Then
   `dict(pe.uk.uk_latest.release_bundle) == identity.release_bundle`, exactly.
4. **Dataset bytes.** The materialised file hashes to `dataset.sha256` and
   has `size_bytes`, before construction and after the last aggregate
   (existing `run_managed_simulation` checks), and the simulation's reported
   runtime dataset source is that file.
5. **Year support.** Requested years must lie in `data_years`, and inside
   every simulation `year in simulation.dataset.years` (when the attribute
   exists) or the run stops. Registry years outside `data_years` are not
   requested by default; they are reported as unsupported (below).

A model/data combination is **incompatible** when no certified variant
records it. There is no flag that relaxes a check: running a newer engine
means adding a variant whose certification names it.

## Unsupported years

Each event registry's `calendar_years` is the construction's window; a
variant runs `calendar_years ∩ data_years`. The rest are **unsupported on the
variant**, with a reason (`before_data_year` or `after_extension_end`).
`RUN_MANIFEST.json` records `supported_years`, `unsupported_years` and
`full_supported_grid_complete`; `full_event_complete` keeps its meaning
(every registry year). Staging marks a source row whose year is unsupported
as `status: "unsupported_on_variant"` with no numerical counterpart, kept in
the row universe and counted separately from `not_computed`. On
`pe6.2.6_uk2.125.1_policyengine-uk-data-1.58.0`, CY2023 is unsupported, so
Spring Budget 2023, Autumn Statement 2023 and Spring Budget 2024 lose their
FY2023–24 counterparts; that loss is shown, never hidden.

## Result namespaces

* Legacy results stay where they are, in `results/uk/events/<event>/`.
* Every other variant writes to `results/uk/replays/<variant_id>/`:
  `VARIANT.json` (the validated record plus the runtime receipt),
  `SUPPORT.json`, `CONSTRUCTION_PREMISES.json`, `MODEL_DIAGNOSTICS.json`,
  `<event>/` (the same files as a legacy event directory), `SUMMARY.md`, and
  finally `REPLAY_RECEIPT.json`.
* `results/uk/replays/INDEX.json` maps each variant to its root (legacy:
  `results/uk/events`), status and receipt.
* A namespace with `REPLAY_RECEIPT.json` is **sealed**: the receipt binds the
  SHA-256 of every file under it, the runner refuses to write there, and CI
  fails if any sealed byte changes. A rerun of the same variant goes to a new
  namespace suffix (`<variant_id>/rerun-<n>`) and its determinism against the
  sealed run is itself a check.
* Release differences live in `results/uk/replays/diffs/<base>__<head>/`.

## Version-scoped diagnoses

Every diagnosis and construction note carries the engine version it was
established on. A comparison row attaches a diagnosis as current only when
the artifact's `engine_version` is in that set. On any other engine the row
carries `prior_diagnoses` with `established_on` and `status:
"not_reverified"` until `diagnose_uk_event_models.py` has been rerun on that
engine, whose per-case predicate records `persists`, `resolved` or
`inconclusive`. The legacy event outputs remain byte-identical.

## Construction premises

`pipeline/audit_uk_event_premises.py` records, for each executable measure,
year and parameter path the construction touches, on a given engine:
current-law value at the annual lookup (1 January of the year), the raw
value at 30 April, the executed baseline-world and reform-world values, and
these checks:

| Check | Fails when |
|---|---|
| `forward_delta_changes_current_law` | A forward delta equals current law in every in-force supported year (inert by construction). |
| `reversal_differs_from_current_law` | A reversal modifier equals current law in every in-force supported year. |
| `derived_counterfactual_reproduces` | Re-deriving `counterfactual_derivation` with this engine's parameters differs from the frozen registry values. |
| `annual_value_matches_30_april_sample` | The processed annual value differs from the raw 30 April value (the engine blends or annualises differently from the 2.89.2 note). |

A failed check is a **construction revision candidate**, reported in the
release diff's construction flags and summarised in
`docs/uk_replay/CONSTRUCTION_REVISIONS.md` with a proposed revision. Running
a revised construction is a methodology change and waits on d1344.

Observed on 2.125.1 on 11 October (parameter tree only):

* `gov.contrib.labour.private_school_vat` is still 0 in every year, so the
  AB2024 VAT forward delta still changes current law.
* The SDLT additional-dwelling scale is still 3/5/8/13/15%, so the AB2024
  forward 2pp delta still applies.
* CGT `basic_rate` at the 2024 annual lookup is 0.1346. In 2.125.1,
  `parameters/gov/hmrc/cgt/basic_rate.yaml` dates the 18% rate from
  2024-10-30 and sets `metadata.fiscal_year_blend: true`, and
  `utils/parameters.convert_to_fiscal_year_parameters` day-weights such
  parameters over 6 April–5 April (`fiscal_year_average`) instead of
  sampling 30 April: 0.10 × 207/365 + 0.18 × 158/365 = 0.1346. The AB2024
  note assumes 2.89.2's raw 2025-04-06 date and 30 April sampling. The
  reversal, first selected in January 2025, leaves the blended 2024 increase
  in both worlds, so CY2024 shows no effect although current law has one.
* The UC childcare cap path (2024 £1,014.63 for one child) and the benefit
  CPI path feed the SB2023 and SS2025 frozen counterfactuals, which were
  derived from 2.89.2's values.
* The Class 2 flat rate for 2023 is £3.45, so the "pin uses £3.15" note is a
  2.89.2 fact only.

## Release differences

`pipeline/diff_uk_event_runs.py --base <variant or root> --head <variant or root>`
compares two complete namespaces, engine-free, after re-verifying each side's
staging and comparison receipts. Keys:

* source row: `(event, source_row_id)`;
* measure-year total: `(event, measure_key, year)`;
* PE head: `(event, measure_key, year, variable)` from artifact `head_effects`.

Flags are descriptive; none is a pass or a failure. A flag names a move to
investigate, and the existing signed PE/OBR bins are reported unchanged as
bin transitions.

| Flag | Raised when |
|---|---|
| `numerical` | Both sides numeric and `abs(head − base) > max(£1,000,000, 0.01 × max(abs(head), abs(base)))`. Strictly greater. |
| `structural` | Sign reversal or a zero crossing (zero means `abs(x) ≤ £0.50`, accounting roundoff); artifact schema or orientation changed; non-finite value. Regardless of size. |
| `coverage` | A counterpart, artifact pair or source row present on one side only, in a year both sides support. |
| `mapping` | A row's `head_variables`, an artifact's `head_channels` or `head_definitions`, or the registry SHA-256 differs. |
| `support` | A year supported on one side only. |
| `inertness` | `inert_construction` on one side only, or identical worlds in an in-force year on one side only. |
| `construction` | Executed `baseline_world`/`reform_world` reform dicts differ, or a premise check's result differs. A changed current-law value of a touched parameter is recorded as context on the row, not flagged: it is what a model release is expected to change. |

Identity changes (wrapper, engine, core, data build, dataset digest) are
recorded once per diff; they explain moves and are not flags on rows.

Outputs: `DIFF.json` (canonical, sorted), `DIFF.md`, and one issue packet per
flagged `(event, measure, year)` under `packets/`. A packet holds the source
cells (table, column, row number, source-row id, OBR value), both execution
identities, registry and artifact digests, the executed reform dicts, the
affected heads with base/head values, focused rerun commands for each
variant, the statutory sources the registry already cites, and empty
`minimal_case` and `statutory_evidence` sections for the investigating lane.
Packets are evidence for the coordinating session, which files upstream
issues; this pipeline files none.

## Qualification requests and receipts

See [QUALIFICATION_INTERFACE.md](QUALIFICATION_INTERFACE.md) for the request
W4 sends before promotion, the receipt returned, and the persistent queue.

## Invariants

Each has deterministic boundary cases and Hypothesis properties in
`tests/`:

* **Exact variant validation.** For any record and environment differing from
  it in one field, validation refuses; for the matching pair it accepts.
* **Support honesty.** No artifact exists for a year outside the variant's
  `data_years`; every registry source row appears exactly once in staging,
  with unsupported years as `unsupported_on_variant`.
* **Replay determinism.** For the same complete execution fingerprint
  (variant identity, registry bytes, measure, year), numerical artifact bytes
  are identical; timings stay in `RUN_LOG.json`.
* **Legacy preservation.** Legacy event registries, staging and comparison
  outputs regenerate byte-identically after these changes.
* **Diff flags.** `diff(a, a)` has no row flags. Flag sets are symmetric under
  swapping sides (with signs reversed). No numerical flag at or below the
  threshold; one strictly above it. Row order and file order do not change
  output bytes.
* **Sealed namespaces.** Every byte under a sealed namespace matches its
  receipt.
