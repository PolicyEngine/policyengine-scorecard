"""Modal app that runs the reform-validation backfill for a populace release.

Why Modal: the producer needs one full Microsimulation per batch plus the
populace/torch import stack, which no longer fits GitHub's 7GB ubuntu-latest
runner — every scheduled run since 2026-07-21 died to the runner's OOM
shutdown signal, including post-chunking (#107) runs where even a single
16-spec levels chunk was killed before its first simulation finished. This
app runs the IDENTICAL producer path (tools/reform_validation/backfill.py,
mounted verbatim from the repo checkout at deploy time) in a 64GB container.

Division of labor with the scheduled workflow
(.github/workflows/reform-validation-backfill.yml):

  GitHub Actions          resolve release id -> spawn this app (fire-and-
  (trigger/commit layer)  forget) -> on a LATER tick, harvest the finished
                          artifact from the Volume -> land it under
                          sources/populace-reform-validation/raw/, re-run
                          scorecard_db.ingest_reform_validation, commit the
                          rebuilt DB, open a PR. No simulation ever runs on
                          the runner, so ticks take seconds.

  This app                clone populace at the requested ref, install the
  (simulation layer)      release-exact policyengine-us/-core from the
                          release manifest at runtime, drive backfill.py
                          with a Volume-backed workdir (batch partials
                          survive interruptions and resume), and publish
                          reform_validation_<release_id>.json to the Volume.

Engine versions are installed at RUNTIME (not baked into the image) because
they are release-exact and change per release; the image carries only the
heavy version-stable dependencies. The producer ref is an argument for the
same reason — no image rebuild per populace commit.

Manual use:
    modal deploy tools/reform_validation/modal_backfill_app.py
    python -c "
    import modal
    fn = modal.Function.from_name('scorecard-reform-validation-backfill', 'backfill')
    print(fn.spawn('<release-id>', '<populace-ref>').object_id)"

Requires Modal credentials (MODAL_TOKEN_ID / MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET) for the
PolicyEngine workspace.
