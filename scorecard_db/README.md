# scorecard_db

The Scorecard database: every claim an external model makes that PolicyEngine
can check, one SQLite file, reform-keyed.

## Design (Max, 2026-08-01)

- **Reform-keyed.** Every row references the policy world it scores:
  `baseline` (current law) for level validation, a PolicyEngine parametric
  reform for score validation, an Axiom rulespec reference reserved. A level
  is a score of the null reform — modes 1 and 2 share one table.
- **Populace-targets shape.** Row = `ledger_fact` (a Ledger
  `validation_comparator` fact id once cataloged; inline publication
  provenance until then) + closed-vocabulary `metric` / `unit_concept` /
  `time_basis` + an open `conditions` mapping (geography, program, subgroup,
  methodological `variant`, `rate_unit`, …). Adapters fail loudly on
  anything unmapped.
- **`calibration_relationship` mandatory** (`consumed_as_target` /
  `seed_source` / `held_out`). Published validation wins = held_out only.
- **History, not state.** `pe_results` keeps every computation (engine
  version × certified data bundle × run); the `comparisons` view joins each
  claim to its latest result. Re-scoring on a new certified artifact appends.
- **Mission control.** `lanes` tracks live stage per source×area lane
  (registered → cataloged → ingested → computed → diagnosing → published →
  regressed); `diagnoses` records adjudications with action links.

## Use

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m scorecard_db.ingest_urban data/scorecard.db
PYTHONPATH=. python -m scorecard_db.ingest_platform data/scorecard.db
python -m pytest tests/test_scorecard_db.py
```

```python
from scorecard_db import ScorecardDB
db = ScorecardDB("data/scorecard.db")
db.comparisons(program="snap", geography="US", held_out_only=True)
db.coverage()
```

## 2026-08-02 harvest population

Second population: the overnight seven-source harvest — 12,401 claims
(JCT 6,771 · Budget Lab 1,229 · CPSP 1,033 · TPC 1,057 · CBO 931 · PWBM
717 · Tax Foundation 663) from staging vendored at
sources/harvest-2026-08-02/ (claims + sha256 manifests + notes; raw
downloads stay outside the repo, pinned by the manifests). Run
everything with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python -m scorecard_db.ingest_harvest data/scorecard.db
```

Schema decisions this population forced (COLLATION worklist):

- **Metric/UnitConcept extensions** for the recurring proposed metrics:
  pct_change_after_tax_income (PERCENT, 0–100 scale), avg_tax_change_usd
  and avg_change_after_tax_income_usd (USD_PER_TAX_UNIT for TPC,
  USD_PER_HOUSEHOLD for PWBM — the denominator split is load-bearing),
  share_with_tax_cut, primary_deficit_change, tax_expenditure (reserved
  for JCX-45-25), poverty_count, and the CBO baseline-detail families
  (IIT walk + program benefit statistics).
- **Period ranges**: ten-year-window claims carry period_start /
  period_end with `period == period_end` and
  conditions["window_kind"] ∈ {total, annual_average}; single-year claim
  ids are unchanged (the window keys enter the hash only when set).
- **policy_ref reforms**: named external policy worlds
  ({"policy": slug, …}) pending PE encoding, with non-current-law
  baselines as ReformRef.baseline descriptors (TCJA extension, JCT
  current policy, TPC current-law + Senate Title VII, …), mirrored to
  conditions["baseline_policy"]. Descriptors stay minimal so identical
  worlds share a reform key across sources — JCX-35-25 / TPC
  T25-0229/0236 / TF's enacted-OBBBA page all key to
  obbba_enacted_title_vii, and the JCX-30/31 manager's-amendment twins
  share a slug and differ only in baseline.
- **Conditions vocabulary** standardized in models.STANDARD_CONDITIONS
  (income_group/income_axis/income_concept, scoring, baseline_policy,
  option, statistic, window_kind, month, data_vintage).
- Deliberate exclusions, tallied in lane notes: TPC's 468
  tax-benefit-family rows (beyond the validation vocabulary).
  T26-0009's original 48 rows (staging defect verified against the
  workbook) were replaced by a coordinate-pinned per-sheet re-parse —
  135 rows, race as conditions["subgroup"] — via
  sources/harvest-2026-08-02/tpc/reparse_t26_0009.py. Same-statistic
  republication twins (68) are merged with rounding-consistency
  assertions; see sources/harvest-2026-08-02/VALIDATION.md for the
  artifact validation.

First population: Urban SotSN — 30,004 claims (24,717 published values).
`calibration_relationship` is assigned per (program, metric) from the
certified build's documented target surface and seeds
(`scorecard_db/relationships.py`), never defaulted: SNAP/SSI participation
and refundable-CTC counts are `consumed_as_target`, TANF participation is
`seed_source` (ASPE/TRIM3), everything else `held_out`. PE results: the
interchange's 678 totals (run `sotsn-first-cut`) plus the platform's 7,912
subgroup × state grid (run `platform-grid-2024`, with the real status
taxonomy and annotation ids); the `comparisons` view serves the latest per
claim. Counterfactual worlds use the `policyengine_us_inputs` framework —
input-override descriptors (forced take-up flags), not parametric reform
paths, because no such parameters exist in the engine.
